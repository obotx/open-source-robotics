===========================

The solution is globally (PCT) patented. 

## General Information

The final licence is not ready yet. It will probably be something similar to The CERN Open Hardware Licence (OHL or CERN OHL). 

The idea is that all content, patents, drawings, instructions, software, etc. will be free to use for personal and research purposes. For commercial use, some fee (like 10%) is planned.
